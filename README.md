Welcome to the Ticket Manager App! This application allows users to manage their tickets efficiently with a user-friendly interface. Itâ€™s built with a React frontend and a Flask backend, using SQLite as the database.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: 
  - **Login**: Users can log in to access their tickets.
  - **Signup**: New users can create an account.
  - **Logout**: Users can securely log out of their session.
  
- **Ticket Management**:
  - View and manage your tickets.
  - Create new tickets.
  - Update ticket status.
  
- **Comments**:
  - Add comments to tickets.
  - View comments associated with each ticket.
  
## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Built with React, featuring client-side routing for a seamless user experience.
- **Backend**: Developed with Flask, providing a robust API for managing users, tickets, and comments.
- **Database**: Utilizes SQLite for data storage, ensuring efficient and reliable data handling.

## Data Relationships

- **User and Tickets**: 
  - A user can create many tickets (one-to-many relationship).
  
- **Tickets and Assignees**:
  - There is a many-to-many relationship between tickets and users (assignees), allowing multiple users to be assigned to a ticket and a user to have multiple tickets.

- **Tickets and Comments**:
  - A user can create many comments on tickets, and each ticket can have multiple comments, allowing for in-depth discussions and updates.

## Association Proxy

To manage the many-to-many relationship between tickets and assignees, we employ an association proxy. This allows us to simplify access and manipulation of the relationships in the database.
